## Section 1: Introduction
Briefly describe your project here.

## Section 2: Methods
Describe your proposed ideas, such as features, algorithms, training overview, design choices, etc., and your environment here. Ensure that:
- A reader can understand why you made your design decisions.
- A reader should be able to recreate your environment (include commands like `conda list`, `conda env export`, etc.).
- Consider including a figure illustrating your ideas, like a flowchart of your machine learning system. (Place it in the "images" folder and link it here using `![Flowchart Description](images/flowchart.png)`).

## Section 3: Experimental Design
Describe the experiments conducted to validate the target contributions of your project:

### Purpose
1-2 sentence high-level explanation of each experiment.

### Baselines
Describe the methods used for comparison.

### Evaluation Metrics
List which metrics were used and why.

## Section 4: Results
Describe your main findings and conclusions drawn from the work:

- Main findings: report final results here.
- Include placeholder figures and tables to communicate findings (use Markdown image and table syntax).

Ensure that all figures containing results are generated from the code.

## Section 5: Conclusions
Concluding remarks:

- Summarize the key take-away from your work in one paragraph.
- Discuss any questions not fully answered by your work and potential future directions.

# main.ipynb

Ensure that your `main.ipynb` notebook includes:

- Alternating text and code cells from start to finish.
- Descriptions above each code cell explaining the intent and choice of the code below.
- Explanations of the outputs of each cell, especially figures, such that a reader understands what they are about to see.

# Additional Resources

## Images Folder
All figures displayed in the `README.md` should be stored in the `images` folder.
