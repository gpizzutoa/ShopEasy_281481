AI & mp; ML Luiss class project
1. A “README.md” file with the following information:
• Title and Team members
• [Section 1] Introduction – Briefly describe your project
• [Section 2] Methods – Describe your proposed ideas (e.g., features, algorithm(s), 
training overview, design choices, etc.) and your environment so that:
• A reader can understand why you made your design decisions and the 
reasons behind any other choice related to the project
• A reader should be able to recreate your environment (e.g., conda list, 
conda envexport, etc.)
• It may help to include a figure illustrating your ideas, e.g., a flowchart 
illustrating the steps in your machine learning system(s)
• [Section 3] Experimental Design – Describe any experiments you conducted to 
demonstrate/validate the target contribution(s) of your project; indicate the 
following for each experiment:
• The main purpose: 1-2 sentence high-level explanation
• Baseline(s): describe the method(s) that you used to compare your work 
to
• Evaluation Metrics(s): which ones did you use and why?
• [Section 4] Results – Describe the following:
• Main finding(s): report your final results and what you might conclude 
from your work
• Include at least one placeholder figure and/or table for communicating 
your findings
• All the figures containing results should be generated from the code.
• [Section 5] Conclusions – List some concluding remarks. In particular:
• Summarize in one paragraph the take-away point from your work.
• Include one paragraph to explain what questions may not be fully 
answered by your work as well as natural next steps for this direction of 
future work
2. single notebook called “main.ipynb” with ALL the code used for the project. The notebook 
must have the following characteristics:
• Text and code cells must alternate from start to finish. The text cell above must 
describe the contents of the code below and its output so that a reader can easily 
follow up on your implementation. In particular:
• You must explain what you will do and why you chose to do so.
• You must explain the outputs of the cell (if any) with particular attention 
to describing figures such that a reader already knows what he is going to 
see
3. An additional folder named “images” contains the figures displayed in the “README.md”.
